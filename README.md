# Recommendation System

This project aims to build a recommendation system using various techniques and algorithms to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: usemy_courses.csv
- `notebooks/`: `rs.ipynb` where the recommendation system is implemented.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `notebooks/rs.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` directory. It is named `usemy_courses.csv` and contains user-item interactions and relevant data for building the recommendation system.

## Implementation

The `rs.ipynb` notebook implements the recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization techniques. It provides instructions on building and evaluating the system.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have built a recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users. By leveraging various algorithms and techniques, we aim to improve the user experience and help users discover relevant items of interest.
